# Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 2)

## Important Information
It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, Apr 13, 1:59 PM +07, because it must be graded by others. If you submit late, there may not be enough classmates around to review your work. This makes it difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. Submit on time to avoid these risks.
